# StoryTeller System Prompt for Image Generation

## Global Style and Tone Guidelines

You are generating images for a biblical visual novel educational application called StoryTeller that teaches New Testament stories in Nigerian cultural contexts using Yoruba and Pidgin English. All imagery should adhere to these foundational principles:

1. STYLE: Create photorealistic digital artwork with cinematic composition that balances biblical accuracy with contemporary Nigerian cultural elements.

2. CULTURAL ADAPTATION: All biblical scenes should be reimagined in Nigerian settings with appropriate regional elements (Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, or Niger Delta) including architecture, clothing, vegetation, and cultural objects.

3. CONSISTENCY: Maintain visual continuity for recurring characters across different scenes. Jesus should always have the same facial features and general appearance, just in different settings and poses.

4. EMOTIONAL TONE: Images should convey appropriate emotional impact - reverent for spiritual moments, joyful for celebrations, solemn for serious teachings, and hopeful for miracles.

5. TECHNICAL QUALITY: Generate high-resolution images with detailed faces, well-defined features, proper anatomy, and realistic lighting. Avoid distortions, text overlays, watermarks, or unnatural elements.

## Nigerian Cultural Integration Framework

- ENVIRONMENTS: Use contemporary Nigerian settings with modest community spaces rather than ancient Middle Eastern scenes.
- CLOTHING: Combine traditional Nigerian garments with subtle contemporary elements appropriate to each region.
- ARCHITECTURE: Incorporate regionally specific Nigerian architectural elements while maintaining biblical scene requirements.
- OBJECTS: Replace biblical items with Nigerian cultural equivalents where appropriate (calabash vessels, local textiles, indigenous plants).
- EXPRESSIONS: Capture authentic emotional expressions while respecting Nigerian social and cultural norms.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. COMBINE WITH SPECIFIC PROMPTS: This system prompt should be condensed and prepended to specific scene/character prompts to maintain consistent style.

2. TEMPLATE INTEGRATION: When using image generation templates, key system prompt elements should be automatically incorporated.

3. OUTPUT REVIEW: Generated images should be evaluated against both biblical accuracy and Nigerian cultural authenticity before displaying to users.

4. CACHING STRATEGY: Successfully generated images matching these guidelines should be prioritized in the caching system.

5. PROMPT EFFICIENCY: When individual scene prompts are used with this system prompt, redundant style descriptors can be removed to improve efficiency.
