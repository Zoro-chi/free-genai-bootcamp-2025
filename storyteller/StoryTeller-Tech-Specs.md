## Image Generation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Generated Image Library
- **Scene Categorization**: Identify 50-75 key scenes across the New Testament
  - Common settings (Jerusalem, Galilee, temples, boats)
  - Key events (miracles, sermons, crucifixion)
  - Character portraits (disciples, Jesus, important figures)
- **Batch Generation Process**:
  - Use Amazon Bedrock SDXL 1.0 v1.0 (Stable Diffusion XL)
  - Generate 3-5 variants of each scene
  - Curate best results manually
- **Cultural Adaptation**:
  - Include Nigerian architectural elements and landscapes
  - Adjust clothing and appearance to be culturally relevant
  - Create style guide for consistent Nigerian representation

### Phase 2: Hybrid Generation System
- **Template-Based Dynamic Prompting**:
  - Create parameterized prompt templates for different scene types:
    ```
    [SCENE_TYPE]: A [TIME_OF_DAY] scene in [LOCATION] showing [CHARACTER] [ACTION] with [EMOTION] expression. Nigerian [REGION] style architecture and clothing. [CULTURAL_ELEMENTS].
    ```
  - Dynamically fill parameters based on current story context
  - Maintain style consistency through prompt constraints
  
- **Scene Analysis Engine**:
  - Automatically identify key narrative moments requiring imagery
  - Extract relevant context parameters from text
  - Determine appropriate template to use
  
- **Efficient API Implementation**:
  - AWS Lambda function to handle image generation requests
  - API Gateway to manage request flow
  - Connect to Amazon Bedrock Titan Image Generator via SDK

### Phase 3: Fully Dynamic Generation
- **Real-time Contextual Generation**:
  - Generate unique images based on narrative progression
  - Create variations based on player choices
  - Dynamic character positioning based on dialogue
  
- **Intelligent Caching System**:
  - Hash-based caching of similar scene requests
  - Store generated images in S3 with metadata tags
  - CDN distribution for fast loading
  - Cache invalidation based on usage patterns

- **Fallback Mechanism**:
  - Detect failed or low-quality generations
  - Substitute similar pre-generated images
  - Implement graceful degradation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Amazon Bedrock Integration
- **Service Configuration**:
  - Model: Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 v1.0
  - Resolution: 1024x1024 for detailed scenes
  - Lower resolution (768x768) for character portraits
  - Inference parameters:
    - CFG Scale: 7.0 (adherence to prompt)
    - Steps: 30 for key images, 20 for less important scenes
    - Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras for best quality/speed balance
    - Seed management for reproducible images when needed

- **Request Optimization**:
  - Batch similar requests where possible
  - Implement request throttling to manage costs
  - Set generation priority levels (critical story moments vs. supplementary scenes)

### Prompt Engineering System
- **Base Prompt Library**:
  - Develop 10-15 base prompt structures for different scene types
  - Create character description templates for consistent portrayal
  - Setting descriptions with cultural adaptation parameters
  
- **Nigerian Cultural Elements Database**:
  - Architectural styles by region
  - Traditional clothing and fabrics
  - Environmental elements (vegetation, landscapes)
  - Historical contextual adaptations
  
- **Dynamic Prompt Assembly Pipeline**:
  1. Parse story text to extract scene context
  2. Select appropriate base prompt template
  3. Fill in dynamic parameters (location, characters, actions)
  4. Add Nigerian cultural modifiers based on language selection
  5. Apply style consistency parameters
  6. Generate and validate output

### Cost Management Strategy
- **Tiered Generation Approach**:
  - Critical scenes: Always dynamically generated
  - Secondary scenes: Use pre-generated with minor variations
  - Background elements: Reuse across similar contexts
  
- **Cache First Strategy**:
  - Check for similar previously generated images before new API calls
  - Implement semantic similarity for scene matching
  - Store frequent user paths to pre-generate likely needed images
  
- **Usage Analytics**:
  - Track generation costs by book/chapter
  - Identify optimization opportunities
  - Set daily/weekly generation limits with transparent user messaging

## Integration with Game Elements
