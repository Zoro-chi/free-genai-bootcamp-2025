    "snippet": "Lyrics to 'Imagine' by John Lennon: Imagine there's no heaven It's easy if you try No hell below us Above us, only sky"
  },
  {

    "link": "https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/3824584/John+Lennon/Imagine",
    "snippet": "Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try. No hell below us, above us only sky. Imagine all the people living for today."
